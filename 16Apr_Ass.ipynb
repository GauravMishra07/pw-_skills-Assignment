    "Increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost algorithm can have a number of effects, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved accuracy: With more estimators, the model can learn more complex patterns in the data, which can lead to improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced bias: With more estimators, the model can be less biased towards any particular weak learner, which can lead to reduced bias in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased variance: With more estimators, the model can become more sensitive to noise in the data, which can lead to increased variance in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased computational complexity: Training an AdaBoost model with more estimators will take longer and require more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of estimators will depend on the specific dataset and the desired accuracy. A good starting point is to use a small number of estimators, such as 10 or 20, and then increase the number of estimators until the accuracy plateaus or starts to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that increasing the number of estimators can also lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. To avoid overfitting, it is important to use regularization techniques, such as early stopping or dropout.\n",
