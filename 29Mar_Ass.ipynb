    "Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. This penalty term penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which has the effect of shrinking the coefficients towards zero. This can help to reduce the number of features that are selected for the model, which can make the model more interpretable and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression is similar to ridge regression, which also adds a penalty term to the OLS objective function. However, the penalty term in lasso regression is the sum of the squares of the coefficients, while the penalty term in ridge regression is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This difference in penalty terms results in different properties for the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key differences between lasso regression and other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression can select a subset of features: Lasso regression can shrink some coefficients to zero, which means that it can select a subset of features for the model. This can make the model more interpretable and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression cannot select a subset of features: Ridge regression does not shrink any coefficients to zero. This means that ridge regression will always include all of the features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression is more robust to multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated. This can make it difficult to estimate the coefficients of the model. Lasso regression is more robust to multicollinearity than ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is more accurate for some datasets: Ridge regression is more accurate than lasso regression for some datasets. This is because ridge regression does not shrink any coefficients to zero, which can help to improve the fit of the model.\n",
