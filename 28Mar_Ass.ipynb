    "Ridge regularization is technique that is used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. It does this by adding a penalty to the model's objective function that is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the model's coefficients. This penalty encourages the coefficients to be small, but it does not force them to be zero, as Lasso regularization does.\n",
