    "R-squared is a statistical measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points. An R-squared of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data. Values of R-squared outside the range 0 to 1 occur when the model fits the data worse than the worst possible least-squares predictor (equivalent to a horizontal hyperplane at a height equal to the mean of the observed data).\n",

    "How is R-squared calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient between the independent and dependent variables. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It can take on any value between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and a value of 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does R-squared represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. In other words, it is a measure of how well the independent variable predicts the dependent variable. For example, if a regression model has an R-squared of 0.7, then it means that 70% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable. The remaining 30% of the variance is due to other factors, such as random error.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to interpret R-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of R-squared depends on the context of the regression model. In general, a higher R-squared value indicates a better fitting model. However, it is important to note that R-squared can be misleading if the independent variable is not a good predictor of the dependent variable. For example, if the independent variable is not correlated with the dependent variable, then R-squared will be close to 0, even if the model is a good fit."

However, the adjusted R-squared value for the first model is 0.65, and the adjusted R-squared value for the second model is 0.60.
