    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is how they calculate the distance between two data points. Euclidean distance calculates the distance as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two data points in each dimension. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, calculates the distance as the sum of the absolute differences between the two data points in each dimension.\n",

    "This difference can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in a few ways. For example, Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than Manhattan distance. This is because Euclidean distance squares the differences between the data points, which can amplify the effect of outliers. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, does not square the differences, so it is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that Euclidean distance treats all dimensions equally, while Manhattan distance can give more weight to certain dimensions depending on the absolute differences between the data points. This can be useful in cases where some dimensions are more important than others for predicting the target variable.\n",

    "1. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model on a held-out dataset. To use cross-validation to choose the optimal k value, you would first divide your training data into multiple folds. Then, you would train a KNN model on each fold using a different value of k. Finally, you would evaluate the performance of each model on the held-out fold. The value of k that produces the best performance on average across all folds is the optimal k value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Elbow method: The elbow method is a graphical technique for choosing the optimal k value. To use the elbow method, you would first plot the training error or validation error of the KNN model as a function of k. The elbow point is the value of k at which the error curve starts to plateau. The elbow point is often considered to be the optimal k value, as it is the point at which the model is able to learn the training data without overfitting.\n",

    "3. Grid search: Grid search is a brute-force technique for choosing the optimal k value. To use grid search, you would first specify a range of k values. Then, you would train a KNN model for each value of k. Finally, you would choose the value of k that produces the best performance on the training or validation dataset."
