    "Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are both statistical methods that use past data to predict future outcomes. However, they differ in the number of independent variables that they use.\n",

    "The main advantage of using multiple linear regression over simple linear regression is that it allows you to control for the effects of other variables. In the example above, the multiple linear regression model controls for the effects of the number of bedrooms and the age of the house when predicting the price of a house. This is important because it ensures that the model is not simply picking up on the correlation between square footage and price that is caused by the other two variables.\n",
