    "Grid search CV is a technique used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are the settings of a model that are not learned during training. They can have a significant impact on the performance of a model, so it is important to tune them carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching a grid of hyperparameter values. For each combination of hyperparameter values, the model is trained and evaluated on a held-out test set. The combination of hyperparameter values that produces the best performance on the test set is chosen as the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to tune the hyperparameters of a logistic regression model. The model has two hyperparameters: the learning rate and the regularization strength. We want to try a range of values for each hyperparameter, so we create a grid of hyperparameter values.\n",

    "Sure. Grid search CV and random search CV are both techniques used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. However, there are some key differences between the two techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV exhaustively searches a grid of hyperparameter values. This means that it tries every combination of hyperparameter values that you specify. This can be a very time-consuming process, especially if you have a large number of hyperparameters to tune. However, grid search CV is a very thorough technique, and it is guaranteed to find the optimal hyperparameters if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized search CV randomly samples hyperparameter values from a distribution. This means that it does not try every combination of hyperparameter values, but it does try a large number of combinations. This can be a much faster process than grid search CV, especially if you have a large number of hyperparameters to tune. However, randomized search CV is not as thorough as grid search CV, and it is possible that it will not find the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other\n",
    "\n",
    "The best choice of technique depends on the specific situation. If you have a small number of hyperparameters to tune, and you have the time to wait for grid search CV to complete, then grid search CV is a good choice. However, if you have a large number of hyperparameters to tune, or if you need to find the optimal hyperparameters quickly, then randomized search CV is a good choice."
