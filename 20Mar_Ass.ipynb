    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another. This is often done to make data more readable or understandable by machines. In data science, encoding is often used to convert categorical data into numerical data. This is because many machine learning algorithms can only work with numerical data.\n",

    "There are many different data encoding techniques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding: This is the simplest form of encoding, where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if you have a categorical variable with three categories (red, green, blue), you could assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to each category, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding: This is a more complex form of encoding where each category is represented by a separate binary variable. For example, if you have a categorical variable with three categories, you would create three binary variables, one for each category. The variable would be set to 1 if the category is present and 0 if it is not.\n",
    "\n",

    "Target encoding: This technique uses the target variable to encode the categorical variable. For example, if you are trying to predict whether a customer will churn, you could use the customer's churn status to encode their age. Customers who churned would be assigned a higher value than customers who did not churn."
