    "The best regression metric to employ in this situation is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE is a measure of the average error between the predicted and actual values.

RMSE is a good metric to use for house price prediction because it is not sensitive to outliers, and it can be easily interpreted.\n",

    "In general, RMSE is considered to be a better metric than MAE for regression problems where there are outliers. This is because MAE is not as sensitive to outliers, which can lead to underestimation of the error. RMSE is also a better metric than R-squared for regression problems where the target variable is not normally distributed.\n",

    "In the case of house price prediction, there are likely to be outliers in the data. This is because there are many factors that can affect the price of a house, and some of these factors are not easily quantifiable. For example, the location of a house can have a significant impact on its price, but it is difficult to assign a numerical value to the location. As a result, it is likely that there will be some houses in the data that are priced significantly higher or lower than the other houses. RMSE is a better metric than MAE for this type of data because it is more sensitive to outliers.\n",
