    "To understand how projections are used in PCA, it is helpful to first understand the concept of a principal component. A principal component is a new direction in the data that is created by projecting the data onto a unit vector.

If you choose too many PCs, you may overfit the data and the PCA model will not generalize well to new data.\n",

The eigenvalues are sorted in decreasing order, so the first PC has the highest eigenvalue and the last PC has the lowest eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scree plot, the eigenvalues typically decrease sharply at first and then level off. The point where the eigenvalues level off is often taken to be a good indication of the number of PCs to choose.\n",
